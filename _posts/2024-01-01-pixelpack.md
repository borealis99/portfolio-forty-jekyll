The PixelPack prototype is my endeavor to have a portable club-style lighting setup that can be easily transported and still fill a room. Based on WLED and a custom ESP32-based controller, the system consists of 8 bars of 120 addressable LEDs that receive commands over ArtNet and link with a single CAT cable to their control box.

Development has moved to the PETAL Project: [https://www.petallighting.com/](https://www.petallighting.com/)
