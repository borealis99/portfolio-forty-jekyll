I’MMORTAL’s audio-visual synesthesia makes fusing otherworldly visuals to her imaginative beats only come naturally to her. Her campy visual work often encompasses themes of death and rebirth, the natural world versus artificial constructs, femininity, and her AAPI identity. I’MMORTAL divulged: "The project is ultimately about rebirth. Rebirth was a massive theme in my life both personally and artistically, and I want my songs to reflect that."
