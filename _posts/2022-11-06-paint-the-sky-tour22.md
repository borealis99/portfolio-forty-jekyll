As projectionist and lighting designer for experimental rock trio Paint the Sky, I create immersive visual environments that transform their performances into transcendent experiences. Working with their unique "in-the-round" concept, I design and operate multi-channel video projections of flowing rivers that envelop the band, blending their forms into living, breathing water imagery. The projection mapping creates a holographic effect where the musicians appear to dissolve and reform within the flowing visuals, reinforcing their conceptual framework that "the micro is the macro" and we are all connected through water. This technical collaboration supports PTS's mission to connect audiences to each other and the planet through their process-oriented, chance-based musical explorations.
